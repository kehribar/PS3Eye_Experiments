# PS3 Eye Camera Experiments

PS3 Eye camera is a great camera for its price point. It can deliver up to 60 FPS video in 640x480 resolution or up to 187 FPS video in 320x240 resolution.

The trick is, PS3 Eye camera isn't a standard 'USB Video Capture Device' and it doesn't get recognized as a standard webcam but thanks to <https://github.com/inspirit/PS3EYEDriver> project, we can use the camera with OSX / Linux / Windows machines.
